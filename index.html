            Hello reader! I'm <b>Danny</b>, currently full-time automation engineer and part-time developer. 
            If you've stumbled upon this site, you're probably looking to know about me right? Born in 1996, I grew up
            in an era of video games and the age of techology evolution. The sheer amount of technology advancement within 
            the past couple decades is mind-blowing. Video games with realistic graphics, mobile devices that allows you to communicate 
            with people across the globe within seconds, watches that can detect your heart rate and even create a ECG scan on the go. All of 
            this is super exciting and is the main drive behind what I love to do. To be apart of the fast-paced advancements in technology is like a dream come true. <br /><br />
                
            My current interest lies in <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>AI</b> topics. Inventions and ideas that seem just out of this world years ago
            are now within our grasps. Self-driving cars, market predictions, facial recognition; all of these involve Machine Learning and
            just being able to see what else is possible would be exciting. I've always wanted to have one of those clear glass terminal 
            screens that you see in futuristic movies or the smart glasses that does real-time analysis. With the pace that technology is
            moving at, I defintely believe it would be something that is now achievable within my lifetime. <br /> <br />
